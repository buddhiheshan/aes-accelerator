#@ #	The variables in this file define the behavior of many parts
#@ #	of the Synopsys Synthesis Tools.  Upon installation, they should 
#@ #	be reviewed and modified to fit your site's needs.  Each engineer
#@ #	can have a .synopsys file in his/her home directory or current
#@ #	directory to override variable settings in this file.  
#@ #
#@ #  	Each logical grouping of variables is commented as to their 
#@ #	nature and effect on the Synthesis Commands.  Examples of
#@ #	variable groups are the Compile Variable Group, which affects 
#@ #	the designs produced by the COMPILE command, and the Schematic 
#@ #	Variable Group, which affects the output of the create_schematic
#@ #	command.
#@ #
#@ #	You can type "man <group_name>_variables" in dc_shell or 
#@ #	design_analyzer to get help about a group of variables.
#@ #	For instance, to get help about the "system" variable group, 
#@ #	type "help system_variables".  You can also type
#@ #	"man <variable name>", to get help on the that variable's

#@ #
#@ # Searching for Tcl Modules. Defines a procedure, declares it as the primary
#@ # command for finding packages, however also uses the former 'package unknown'
#@ # command as a fallback.
#@ #
#@ # Locates all possible packages in a directory via a less restricted glob. The
#@ # targeted directory is derived from the name of the requested package, i.e.
#@ # the TM scan will look only at directories which can contain the requested
#@ # package. It will register all packages it found in the directory so that
#@ # future requests have a higher chance of being fulfilled by the ifneeded
#@ # database without having to come to us again.
#@ #
#@ # We do not remember where we have been and simply rescan targeted directories
#@ # when invoked again. The reasoning is this:
#@ #
#@ # - The only way we get back to the same directory is if someone is trying to
#@ #   [package require] something that wasn't there on the first scan.
#@ #
#@ #   Either
#@ #   1) It is there now:  If we rescan, you get it; if not you don't.
#@ #
#@ #      This covers the possibility that the application asked for a package
#@ #      late, and the package was actually added to the installation after the
#@ #      application was started. It shoukld still be able to find it.
#@ #
#@ #   2) It still is not there: Either way, you don't get it, but the rescan
#@ #      takes time. This is however an error case and we dont't care that much
#@ #      about it
#@ #
#@ #   3) It was there the first time; but for some reason a "package forget" has
#@ #      been run, and "package" doesn't know about it anymore.
#@ #
#@ #      This can be an indication that the application wishes to reload some
#@ #      functionality. And should work as well.
#@ #
#@ # Note that this also strikes a balance between doing a glob targeting a
#@ # single package, and thus most likely requiring multiple globs of the same
#@ # directory when the application is asking for many packages, and trying to
#@ # glob for _everything_ in all subdirectories when looking for a package,
#@ # which comes with a heavy startup cost.
#@ #
#@ # We scan for regular packages only if no satisfying module was found.

#@ #  USAGE:  itk::remove_destroy_hook <widget>
#@ #
#@ #  Used internally via "itk_component delete" when disconnecting a
#@ #  component <widget> from the mega-widget that contains it.
#@ #  Each component has a special binding for the <Destroy> event
#@ #  that causes it to disconnect itself from its parent when destroyed.
#@ #  This procedure removes the binding from the binding tag list and
#@ #  deletes the binding.  It is much easier to implement this in
#@ #  Tcl than C.
